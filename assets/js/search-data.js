        "excerpt":"All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end. Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. This post has a manual excerpt &lt;!--more--&gt; set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied: excerpt_separator: \"&lt;!--more--&gt;\"If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on. I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still. Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more. Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights. Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance. ","categories": ["docs","Post Formats"],

It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me. Left Aligned This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment. Center Aligned This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes. Right Aligned This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss. Justify Aligned This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude. No Wrap This is a paragraph. It has a no wrap.

Assign classes with HTML: &lt;img src=\"image.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"image.jpg\" class=\"align-center\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"image.jpg\" class=\"align-right\" alt=\"\"&gt;Or use Kramdown and inline attribute lists: ![left-aligned-image](image.jpg){: .align-left}![center-aligned-image](image.jpg){: .align-center}![right-aligned-image](image.jpg){: .align-right} The image should be centered with the .align-center class.  The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned with the .align-left class. As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thing. Mission accomplished! And now for a massively large image — it has no alignment.  The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.  And now we’re going to shift things to the right with the .align-right class. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there — Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently. In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah — Just like that. It never felt so good to be right. And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!     Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.The figure above happens to be centered. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.

        "excerpt":"用jekyll的原因无需多说。这样配置好工作流之后，除了编写内容基本没有什么麻烦的操作(登录在线网页，换编辑器之类在我看来都很麻烦。。)。 Ruby的环境管理，包管理方式   管理顺序： churby -&gt; ruby -&gt; bundle -&gt; gem -&gt; jekyll          ruby： 是经常在 web 开发中使用的一种动态语言。      churby： Ruby 的环境管理工具，用于管理不同版本的 Ruby。      gem： Ruby 编写的软件包的统称，Jekyll 也是一个 gem。      bundler： 用于管理项目 gem 的工具，根据 Gemfile 管理不同版本的 gem。bundler自己本身也是gem。      如果用 Python 来类比，关系大概是这样：             ruby      python                  churby 版本号      conda create -n my_env python=版本号; conda activate my_env              gem install 某个包      pip install 某个包              bundler install      pip install -r requirements.txt      具体配置流程   安装ruby          按照 Jekyll 网站 的方法，安装 Chruby 和 Ruby-install。      切换到对应版本的 Ruby。      在 macOS 中我遇到的问题是系统中已经安装了 Miniforge3，其中包含了 OpenSSL，但不能正常使用。通过 Homebrew 安装 OpenSSL@1.1 解决。        本地配置          选择一个博客主题，例如 So Simple，fork 对应主题的 GitHub 代码，然后根据自己的需要修改 _config.yml。      运行 bundler install 安装项目所需的 gem。      运行 bundle exec jekyll serve，此时可以在本地进行预览。        利用 GitHub Actions 部署到 GitHub Pages          将下面的 Action 脚本添加到项目的 .github/workflows/main.yml 文件。等待执行完成，可以通过浏览器访问 http://name.github.io/base_url/。         name: Homepage Project Deploy to GitHub Pages\t on:   push:     branches:       - master #设置每次将代码推送到 master 分支时自动执行\t permissions:   contents: write\t jobs:     deploy:       runs-on: ubuntu-latest       steps:       - name: Checkout repository         uses: actions/checkout@v4\t       - name: Set up ruby and gems         uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1 #如果用ruby install的话好像没法切换版本         with:           ruby-version: '3.2' # Not needed with a .ruby-version file           bundler-cache: true # runs 'bundle install' and caches installed gems automatically\t       - name: Build and deploy         run: |             bundle exec jekyll build             echo 'personal-homepage' &gt; _site/CNAME             cp _site/index.html _site/404.html             touch _site/.nojekyll #必须的，gh-pages分支没有环境，必须要跳过build         env:             BASE_URL: '/personal-homepage/'  # Adjust this based on your repository name\t       - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages         uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3         with:             GITHUB_TOKEN: $             BRANCH: gh-pages             FOLDER: _site              因为actions里有写入操作，需要先去账户生成一个有权限的token。具体参考github文档      还需要在repo setting里把gh-pages设置为pages对应的branch 。        更新内容：          在 docs/_posts 中更新内容。因为我平时笔记都是在 Obsidian 中编辑的，决定在 Obsidian 中设置一个文件夹，然后将每篇笔记同步到 docs/_posts 文件夹中。      用obsidian的优点：                  Markdown 格式, 包括Front Matter在 Obsidian 中显示非常舒适。                                           利用 Obsidian 的update-time-on-edit 插件，可以自动更新 last_modified_date。          利用 Obsidian 的 unique note 插件，可以通过点击生成符合格式的笔记模板。                      同步：          大部分 Obsidian 的 Markdown 格式是直接兼容的。为了同步，我编写了一个 Bash 脚本sync_homepage.sh ，把双链改成 Markdown 链接，并将文章中链接的图片同步到 docs/attachment 文件夹下。      注意代码块可能会解析错误，所以在脚本里把ruby的代码块都替换成Liquid语法。      问题：目前不支持增量同步，每次同步都需要遍历所有文件，但由于都是文本文件，影响较小。        和raycast联动:          然后给脚本设置raycast的标记。这样每次在obsidian里面编辑完，直接用raycast快捷键同步。       sync_homepage.sh 示范： \t#!/bin/bash\t\t# Required parameters:\t# @raycast.schemaVersion 1\t# @raycast.title sync_homepage\t# @raycast.mode compact\t\t# obsidian文件夹路径\tsource_folder=\"...\"\t\t# homepage项目doc/_post文件夹路径\ttarget_folder=\".../docs/_posts\"\t\t# 附件源文件夹路径\tattachment_source=\"...\"\t\t# 附件目标文件夹路径\tattachment_target=\".../docs/attachment\"\t\t# 检查附件目标文件夹是否存在，如果不存在则创建\tif [ ! -d \"$attachment_target\" ]; then\t\tmkdir -p \"$attachment_target\"\tfi\t\t# 遍历源文件夹中的所有 .md 文件\tfor file in \"$source_folder\"/*.md; do\t\t# 获取文件名（不包含路径）\t\tfilename=$(basename \"$file\")\t\t\t\t# 复制 .md 文件到目标文件夹\t\tcp \"$file\" \"$target_folder/$filename\"\t\techo \"Copying $file to $target_folder/$filename\"\t\t# 遍历文件中的每个匹配的图片链接，提取图片文件名\t\tgrep -oE \"!\\[\\[([^]]+)\\]\\]\" \"$target_folder/$filename\" | while IFS= read -r image_link; do\t\t\t\t\timage_name=$(echo \"$image_link\" | sed -E 's/!\\[\\[([^|]+)\\|[^]]+\\]\\]/\\1/g') \t\t\timage_width=$(echo \"$image_link\" | grep -o -E '\\|\\d+' | sed 's/|//')\t\t\t\tsed -i '' -E 's/!\\[\\[([^|]+)\\|'${image_width}'\\]\\]/\\!\\[\\1\\]\\({{ '\\''\\/docs\\/attachment\\/\\1'\\'' | relative_url }}\\){:width=\"'${image_width}'\"}/g' \"$target_folder/$filename\"\t\t\t\t# 复制附件文件到目标附件文件夹\t\t\tcp \"$attachment_source/$image_name\" \"$attachment_target/\"\t\t\techo \"Copying $attachment_source/$image_name to $attachment_target/\"\t\tdone\t\t# 替换ruby 代码块为Liquid语法\t\t...\tdone\t","categories": ["docs","WebPage"],
